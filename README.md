# Meteo Station
  - The project consists in the wireless transmission of encrypted data between a weather station and a base station.
  - The weather station is based on an Arduino model connected to 2 sensors and a wireless device.
  - The base station is made of a Raspberry Pi model connected to the second wireless device.
  - The data is encrypted with an RSA algorithm and transmitted through a Master-Slave protocol between the two stations.
